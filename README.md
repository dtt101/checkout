# Checkout Coding Challenge

This repo contains a Checkout based coding challenge and a response. More details on the challenge can be found in `docs/checkout.md`

## Installation

The challenge response is written in Ruby.

Use a version manager to get the version of Ruby required - examples include [RVM](https://rvm.io/), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [Frum](https://github.com/tako8ki/frum)

Note the task specifies asks for version `2.6.6p146` which is not available via rbenv so `2.6.6` has been specified in `.ruby-version`. If required the more specific version can be [downloaded and compiled](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions).
